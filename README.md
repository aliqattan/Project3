Project 3 
Research and Analysis: 
If I am being honest, this project would not be done without the assistance of my biomedical/electrical engineer of a brother and a whole lot of YouTube. I understand this is not ideal and this is not part of the project but I have no idea what I am doing in my life. I just signed with the Marines active duty without even thinking about it.
The research and analysis of this project came with the help of the sources listed above. I watched over 24 YouTube videos on different keywords used in the description of the project. I asked my brother to help me put it all on paper and he outlined the main flow of the program, and with his assistance I managed to code this project with him checking my progress every few lines. I wouldnâ€™t have been able to get this done on my own as he had to delete many lines and teach me other and better ways to write them. 
Design: 
1.	This program will allow the used to enter the maximum number of students that will then create an array of that size.
2.	Once that happens, a list of options will be presented to the user.
3.	The options include; adding a new student to the existing array. The program will as the user to enter the data of that student.
4.	Another option allows the user to delete an active student account. A user ID must be entered in order for that to happen. 
5.	Another option will allow the user to search for a specific students account with their ID.
6.	Another option will present a list of all the active students when selected.
7.	And finally, the last option will allow the user to exit back to the main menu.

Testing: 
I pressed run and if the program was not presented as the example you provided then I went back and made changes and fixed mistakes.
